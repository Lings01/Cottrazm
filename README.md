# Cottrazm: Construct Tumor Transition Zone (Boundary) Microenvironment based on spatial transcriptomics
Cottrazm (**Co**nstruct **T**umor **Tra**nsition **Z**one (Boundary) **M**icroenvironment based on spatial transcriptomics) aims to construct the microenvironment of tumor boundary based on spatial transcriptomics, single-cell transcriptomics and HE-stained histological images. It consists of three core functions: determining the tumor boundary (Cottrazm-BoundaryDefine), deconvoluting spatial transcriptomics (Cottrazm-SpatialDecon), and reconstructing a spatial gene expression matrix for sub-spots (Cottrazm-SpatialRecon).

 Taken together, Cottrazm provides an integrated tool framework to dissect the tumor spatial microenvironment and facilitates the discovery of functional biological insights, thereby identifying therapeutic targets in oncologic ST datasets.
